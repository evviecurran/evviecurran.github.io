Working with HTML and CSS to make a website interactive

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project is a profile made using CSS and HTML. When a user goes to this website they can click on the three main headers and be brought to clicked on section. 

HOW TO USE PROJECT: The site is interactive and when certain things are click you are given that information

I plan to add more to this website as I learn more about different coding techniques. I plan to have this website more interactive with more projects included.

LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT I was able to understand how to consolidate code and make comments on what certain code does.
